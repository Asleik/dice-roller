# Dice Roller

This is a simple dice rolling program without GUI. All info and feedback are outputted through .print() method.

Example outputs:
```
d4: 
     /\
    /1 \
   /    \
  /      \
 /        \
/ 4      3 \
------------

d6: 
 --------- 
| o       |
|         |
|    o    |
|         |
|       o |
 --------- 

d8: 
  /\
 /  \
/  2 \
------
\ 6  /
 \  /
  \/
```

Good for python newcomers, because I am explaining in details how it works and all concepts involved in it.

To execute it, just run the `main` file

--or--

Access its [ipynb file](https://github.com/Asleik/dice-roller/blob/main/dice_roller.ipynb) and click on "Open in Colab" button.

> P.S.: The D10, D12 and D20 objects aren't printing "ASCII-like" because I just realized there is nothing new to learn by implementing its printing method.
